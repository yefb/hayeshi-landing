# About Hayeshi

Hayeshi S.A.S. is an indie software company founded in Colombia.

We build products that respect user privacy and focus on core functionality. Our philosophy is inspired by independent developers who prioritize quality over growth-at-any-cost.

Our first app, **GardenOS**, launches in early 2025 - a privacy-first plant care journal for iOS.

## Our Approach

We believe in building sustainable software that serves real needs without compromising on quality or ethics. No venture capital, no data mining, no shortcuts.

## Founded

Hayeshi S.A.S. was established in Colombia and operates internationally, with a focus on creating products that make a lasting positive impact.
