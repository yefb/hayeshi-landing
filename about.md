# About Hayeshi

Hayeshi is an indie software studio based in Medellín, Colombia. We build privacy-first apps that respect your time and data.

## Our Philosophy

We believe great software should be:

- **Private by default** — Your data belongs to you, not us
- **Focused** — Do one thing well, without feature bloat
- **Sustainable** — Built to last, not to flip

No venture capital. No growth hacking. No data mining. Just thoughtful software that solves real problems.

## Our Apps

**GardenOS** is our first app — a beautiful journal for plant lovers. Track your plants' growth, capture moments, and build a record that stays entirely on your device.
